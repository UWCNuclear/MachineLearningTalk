<h2 id="___sec6">Types of Machine Learning </h2>

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-normal">
<b></b>
<p>
The approaches to machine learning are many, but are often split into two main categories. 
In <em>supervised learning</em> we know the answer to a problem,
and let the computer deduce the logic behind it. On the other hand, <em>unsupervised learning</em>
is a method for finding patterns and relationship in data sets without any prior knowledge of the system.
Some authours also operate with a third category, namely <em>reinforcement learning</em>. This is a paradigm 
of learning inspired by behavioural psychology, where learning is achieved by trial-and-error, 
solely from rewards and punishment.

<p>
Another way to categorize machine learning tasks is to consider the desired output of a system.
Some of the most common tasks are:

<ul>

<p><li> Classification: Outputs are divided into two or more classes. The goal is to   produce a model that assigns inputs into one of these classes. An example is to identify  digits based on pictures of hand-written ones. Classification is typically supervised learning.</li>

<p><li> Regression: Finding a functional relationship between an input data set and a reference data set.   The goal is to construct a function that maps input data to continuous output values.</li>

<p><li> Clustering: Data are divided into groups with certain common traits, without knowing the different groups beforehand.  It is thus a form of unsupervised learning.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="___sec8">ML in Nuclear Physics, Examples </h2>

<p>
The large amount of degrees of freedom pertain to both theory and experiment in nuclear physics. With increasingly complicated experiments that produce large amounts data, automated classification of events becomes increasingly important. Here, deep learning methods offer a plethora of interesting research avenues. 

<ul>
<p><li> Reconstruction of particle trajectories or classification of events are typical examples where ML methods are being used. However, since these data can often be extremely noisy, the precision necessary for discovery in physics requires algorithmic improvements. Research along such directions, interfacing nuclear physics with AI/ML is expected to play a significant role in physics discoveries related to new facilities.  The treatment of corrupted data in imaging and image processing is also a relevant topic.</li> 
<p><li> Design of detectors represents an important area of applications for ML/AI methods in nuclear physics.</li>
<p><li> Many of the above classification problems have also have direct application in theoretical nuclear physics (including Lattice QCD calculations).</li>
</ul>
</section>


<section>
<h2 id="___sec9">More examples  </h2>

<ul>
<p><li> An important application of AI/L methods is to improve the estimation of bias or uncertainty due to the introduction of or lack of physical constraints in various theoretical models.</li>
<p><li> In theory, we expect to use AI/ML algorithms and methods to improve our knowledged about  correlations of physical model parameters in data for quantum many-body systems. Deep learning methods like Boltzmann machines and various types of Recurrent Neural networks show great promise in circumventing the exploding dimensionalities encountered in quantum mechanical many-body studies.</li> 
<p><li> Merging a frequentist approach (the standard path in ML theory) with a Bayesian approach, has the potential to infer better probabilitity distributions and error estimates. As an example, methods for fast Monte-Carlo- based Bayesian computation of nuclear density functionals show great promise in providing a better understanding</li> 
<p><li> Machine Learning and Quantum Computing is a very interesting avenue to explore.</li>

<h2 id="___sec11">What are the basic ingredients? </h2>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-normal">
<b></b>
<p>
Almost every problem in ML and data science starts with the same ingredients:

<ul>
<p><li> The dataset \( \mathbf{x} \) (could be some observable quantity of the system we are studying)</li>
<p><li> A model which is a function of a set of parameters \( \mathbf{\alpha} \) that relates to the dataset, say a likelihood  function \( p(\mathbf{x}\vert \mathbf{\alpha}) \) or just a simple model \( f(\mathbf{\alpha}) \)</li>
<p><li> A so-called <b>loss/cost/risk</b> function \( \mathcal{C} (\mathbf{x}, f(\mathbf{\alpha})) \) which allows us to decide how well our model represents the dataset.</li> 
</ul>
<p>

We seek to minimize the function \( \mathcal{C} (\mathbf{x}, f(\mathbf{\alpha})) \) by finding the parameter values which minimize \( \mathcal{C} \). This leads to  various minimization algorithms. It may surprise many, but at the heart of all machine learning algortihms there is an optimization problem.

<h2 id="___sec12">Neural network types </h2>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-normal">
<b></b>
<p>
An artificial neural network (NN), is a computational model that consists of layers of connected neurons, or <em>nodes</em>. 
It is supposed to mimic a biological nervous system by letting each neuron interact with other neurons
by sending signals in the form of mathematical functions between layers. 
A wide variety of different NNs have
been developed, but most of them consist of an input layer, an output layer and eventual layers in-between, called
<em>hidden layers</em>. All layers can contain an arbitrary number of nodes, and each connection between two nodes
is associated with a weight variable.

where the color intensity of each point indicates higher charge values

a large fraction of noise, while the top row shows a proton event
almost free of noise. See <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02757" target="_blank">Unsupervised Learning for Identifying Events in Active Target Experiments by Solli et al.</a> for more detials.

<section>
<h2 id="___sec14">Why Machine Learning? </h2>

<p>
The traditional Monte Carlo event selection process does not have a
well-defined method to quantify the effectiveness of the event
selection.

<p>
In addition, the selection task normally produces  a binary result only, either
a <b>good</b> or <b>bad</b> fit to the event of interest. A <b>bad</b>
fit is then assumed to be a different event type, and is removed from
the analysis.

<p>
In a broader perspective, an
unsupervised classification algorithm would offer the possibility to
<em>discover</em> rare events which may not be expected or are
overlooked. These events would likely be filtered out using the
traditional methods. From a practical point of view, compared to
supervised learning, it also avoids the necessary labeling task of the
learning set events, which is error prone and time consuming.
</section>


<section>
<h2 id="___sec15">Why Machine Learning for Experimental Analysis? </h2>

<p>
The \( \chi^2 \) approach used in the traditional analysis performed on
the $^{46}$Ar data is extremely expensive from a computational stand
because it involves the simulation of thousands of tracks for each
recorded event.

<p>
These events are in turn simulated for each iteration of the Monte
Carlo fitting sequence.  Even though the reaction of interest in the
above experiment had the largest cross section (elastic scattering),
the time spent on Monte Carlo fitting of <em>all</em> of the events
produced in the experiment was the largest computational bottleneck in
the analysis. In the case of an experiment where the reaction of
interest would represent less than a few percent of the total cross
section, this procedure would become highly inefficient and
prohibitive. Adding to this the large amount of data produced in this
experiment (with even larger data sets expected in future
experiments), the analysis simply begs for more efficient analysis
tools.
</section>


<section>
<h2 id="___sec16">More arguments </h2>

<p>
The computationally expensive fitting procedure
would be applied to every event, instead of the few percent of the
events that are of interest for the analysis.  An unsupervised ML
algorithm able to separate the data without <em>a priori</em> knowledge
of the different types of events increases the efficiency of the
analysis tremendously, and allows the downstream analysis to
concentrate on the fitting efforts only on events of interest. In
addition, the clustering allows for more exploration of the data,
potentially enabling new discovery of unexpected reaction types.

<h2 id="___sec17">The first theoretical system: electrons in a harmonic oscillator trap in two dimensions </h2>

<p>
The Hamiltonian of the quantum dot is given by
<p>&nbsp;<br>
$$ \hat{H} = \hat{H}_0 + \hat{V}, 
$$
<p>&nbsp;<br>

where \( \hat{H}_0 \) is the many-body HO Hamiltonian, and \( \hat{V} \) is the
inter-electron Coulomb interactions. In dimensionless units,
<p>&nbsp;<br>
$$ \hat{V}= \sum_{i < j}^N \frac{1}{r_{ij}},
$$
<p>&nbsp;<br>

with \( r_{ij}=\sqrt{\mathbf{r}_i^2 - \mathbf{r}_j^2} \).

<p>
This leads to the  separable Hamiltonian, with the relative motion part given by (\( r_{ij}=r \))
<p>&nbsp;<br>
$$ 
\hat{H}_r=-\nabla^2_r + \frac{1}{4}\omega^2r^2+ \frac{1}{r},
$$
<p>&nbsp;<br>

plus a standard Harmonic Oscillator problem  for the center-of-mass motion.
This system has analytical solutions in two and three dimensions (<a href="https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.48.3561" target="_blank">M. Taut 1993 and 1994</a>).

<p>
Given a hamiltonian \( H \) and a trial wave function \( \Psi_T \), the variational principle states that the expectation value of \( \langle H \rangle \), defined through 
<p>&nbsp;<br>
$$
   \langle E \rangle =
   \frac{\int d\boldsymbol{R}\Psi^{\ast}_T(\boldsymbol{R})H(\boldsymbol{R})\Psi_T(\boldsymbol{R})}
        {\int d\boldsymbol{R}\Psi^{\ast}_T(\boldsymbol{R})\Psi_T(\boldsymbol{R})},

is an upper bound to the ground state energy \( E_0 \) of the hamiltonian \( H \), that is 
<p>&nbsp;<br>
$$
    E_0 \le \langle E \rangle.
$$
<p>&nbsp;<br>

In general, the integrals involved in the calculation of various  expectation values  are multi-dimensional ones. Traditional integration methods such as the Gauss-Legendre will not be adequate for say the  computation of the energy of a many-body system.

<h2 id="___sec21">Energy derivatives </h2>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-normal">
<b></b>
<p>
To find the derivatives of the local energy expectation value as function of the variational parameters, we can use the chain rule and the hermiticity of the Hamiltonian.

<p>
Let us define (with the notation \( \langle E[\boldsymbol{\alpha}]\rangle =\langle  E_L\rangle \))
<p>&nbsp;<br>
$$
\bar{E}_{\alpha_i}=\frac{d\langle  E_L\rangle}{d\alpha_i},
$$
<p>&nbsp;<br>

as the derivative of the energy with respect to the variational parameter \( \alpha_i \)
We define also the derivative of the trial function (skipping the subindex \( T \)) as 
<p>&nbsp;<br>
$$
\bar{\Psi}_{i}=\frac{d\Psi}{d\alpha_i}.
$$
<p>&nbsp;<br>
</div>

<section>
<h2 id="___sec22">Derivatives of the local energy </h2>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-normal">
<b></b>
<p>
The elements of the gradient of the local energy are then (using the chain rule and the hermiticity of the Hamiltonian)
<p>&nbsp;<br>
$$
\bar{E}_{i}= 2\left( \langle \frac{\bar{\Psi}_{i}}{\Psi}E_L\rangle -\langle \frac{\bar{\Psi}_{i}}{\Psi}\rangle\langle E_L \rangle\right).
$$
<p>&nbsp;<br>

From a computational point of view it means that you need to compute the expectation values of 
<p>&nbsp;<br>
$$
\langle \frac{\bar{\Psi}_{i}}{\Psi}E_L\rangle,
$$
<p>&nbsp;<br>

and
<p>&nbsp;<br>
$$
\langle \frac{\bar{\Psi}_{i}}{\Psi}\rangle\langle E_L\rangle
$$
<p>&nbsp;<br>

<p>
These integrals are evaluted using MC intergration (with all its
possible error sources).  We can then use methods like stochastic
gradient or other minimization methods to find the optimal variational
parameters (I don't discuss this topic here, but these methods are
very important in ML).

<h2 id="___sec23">Why Boltzmann machines? </h2>

<p>
What is known as restricted Boltzmann Machines (RMB) have received a
lot of attention lately.  One of the major reasons is that they can be
stacked layer-wise to build deep neural networks that capture
complicated statistics.

<p>
The original RBMs had just one visible layer and a hidden layer, but
recently so-called Gaussian-binary RBMs have gained quite some
popularity in imaging since they are capable of modeling continuous
data that are common to natural images.

<p>
Furthermore, they have been used to solve complicated quantum
mechanical many-particle problems or classical statistical physics
problems like the Ising and Potts classes of models.

<h2 id="___sec24">A standard BM setup </h2>

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-normal">
<b></b>
<p>
A standard BM network is divided into a set of observable and visible units \( \hat{x} \) and a set of unknown hidden units/nodes \( \hat{h} \).
</div>

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-normal">
<b></b>
<p>
Additionally there can be bias nodes for the hidden and visible layers. These biases are normally set to \( 1 \).
</div>

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-normal">
<b></b>
<p>
BMs are stackable, meaning we can train a BM which serves as input to another BM. We can construct deep networks for learning complex PDFs. The layers can be trained one after another, a feature which makes them popular in deep learning
</div>

<p>
However, they are often hard to train. This leads to the introduction of so-called restricted BMs, or RBMS.
Here we take away all lateral connections between nodes in the visible layer as well as connections between nodes in the hidden layer. The network is illustrated in the figure below.

</section>


<section>
<h2 id="___sec26">The network </h2>

<p>
<b>The network layers</b>:

<ol>
 <p><li> A function \( \mathbf{x} \) that represents the visible layer, a vector of \( M \) elements (nodes). This layer represents both what the RBM might be given as training input, and what we want it to be able to reconstruct. This might for example be the pixels of an image, the spin values of the Ising model, or coefficients representing speech.</li>
 <p><li> The function \( \mathbf{h} \) represents the hidden, or latent, layer. A vector of \( N \) elements (nodes). Also called "feature detectors".</li>
</ol>
</section>


<section>
<h2 id="___sec27">Joint distribution </h2>

<p>
The restricted Boltzmann machine is described by a Boltzmann distribution
<p>&nbsp;<br>
$$
\begin{align}
	P_{rbm}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{h}) = \frac{1}{Z} e^{-\frac{1}{T_0}E(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{h})},
\tag{1}
\end{align}
$$
<p>&nbsp;<br>

where \( Z \) is the normalization constant or partition function, defined as 
<p>&nbsp;<br>
$$
\begin{align}
	Z = \int \int e^{-\frac{1}{T_0}E(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{h})} d\mathbf{x} d\mathbf{h}.
\tag{2}
\end{align}
$$
<p>&nbsp;<br>

It is common to ignore \( T_0 \) by setting it to one.
</section>


<section>
<h2 id="___sec28">Defining different types of RBMs </h2>

<p>
There are different variants of RBMs, and the differences lie in the types of visible and hidden units we choose as well as in the implementation of the energy function \( E(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{h}) \).

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-normal">
<b>Binary-Binary RBM:</b>
<p>
RBMs were first developed using binary units in both the visible and hidden layer. The corresponding energy function is defined as follows:
<p>&nbsp;<br>
$$
\begin{align}
	E(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{h}) = - \sum_i^M x_i a_i- \sum_j^N b_j h_j - \sum_{i,j}^{M,N} x_i w_{ij} h_j,
\tag{3}
\end{align}
$$
<p>&nbsp;<br>

where the binary values taken on by the nodes are most commonly 0 and 1.
</div>

<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-normal">
<b>Gaussian-Binary RBM:</b>
<p>
Another variant is the RBM where the visible units are Gaussian while the hidden units remain binary:
<p>&nbsp;<br>
$$
\begin{align}
	E(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{h}) = \sum_i^M \frac{(x_i - a_i)^2}{2\sigma_i^2} - \sum_j^N b_j h_j - \sum_{i,j}^{M,N} \frac{x_i w_{ij} h_j}{\sigma_i^2}. 
\tag{4}
\end{align}
$$
<p>&nbsp;<br>
</div>
</section>


<section>
<h2 id="___sec29">Representing the wave function </h2>

<p>
The wavefunction should be a probability amplitude depending on \( \boldsymbol{x} \). The RBM model is given by the joint distribution of \( \boldsymbol{x} \) and \( \boldsymbol{h} \)
<p>&nbsp;<br>
$$
\begin{align}
	F_{rbm}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{h}) = \frac{1}{Z} e^{-\frac{1}{T_0}E(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{h})}.
\tag{5}
\end{align}
$$
<p>&nbsp;<br>

To find the marginal distribution of \( \boldsymbol{x} \) we set:
<p>&nbsp;<br>
$$
\begin{align}
	F_{rbm}(\mathbf{x}) &= \sum_\mathbf{h} F_{rbm}(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{h}) 
\tag{6}\\
				&= \frac{1}{Z}\sum_\mathbf{h} e^{-E(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{h})}.
\tag{7}
\end{align}
$$
<p>&nbsp;<br>

Now this is what we use to represent the wave function, calling it a neural-network quantum state (NQS)
<p>&nbsp;<br>
$$
\begin{align}
	\Psi (\mathbf{x}) &= F_{rbm}(\mathbf{x}) 
\tag{8}\\
	&= \frac{1}{Z}\sum_{\boldsymbol{h}} e^{-E(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{h})} 
\tag{9}\\
	&= \frac{1}{Z} \sum_{\{h_j\}} e^{-\sum_i^M \frac{(x_i - a_i)^2}{2\sigma^2} + \sum_j^N b_j h_j + \sum_{i,j}^{M,N} \frac{x_i w_{ij} h_j}{\sigma^2}} 
\tag{10}\\
	&= \frac{1}{Z} e^{-\sum_i^M \frac{(x_i - a_i)^2}{2\sigma^2}} \prod_j^N (1 + e^{b_j + \sum_i^M \frac{x_i w_{ij}}{\sigma^2}}). 
\tag{11}\\
\tag{12}
\end{align}
$$

<h2 id="___sec30">Choose the cost/loss function </h2>

<p>
Now we don't necessarily have training data (unless we generate it by
using some other method). However, what we do have is the variational
principle which allows us to obtain the ground state wave function by
minimizing the expectation value of the energy of a trial wavefunction
(corresponding to the untrained NQS). Similarly to the traditional
variational Monte Carlo method then, it is the local energy we wish to
minimize. The gradient to use for the stochastic gradient descent
procedure is

<p>&nbsp;<br>
$$
\begin{align}
	\frac{\partial \langle E_L \rangle}{\partial \theta_i}
	= 2(\langle E_L \frac{1}{\Psi}\frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial \theta_i} \rangle - \langle E_L \rangle \langle \frac{1}{\Psi}\frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial \theta_i} \rangle ),
\tag{13}
\end{align}
$$
<p>&nbsp;<br>

where the local energy is given by
<p>&nbsp;<br>
$$
\begin{align}
	E_L = \frac{1}{\Psi} \hat{\mathbf{H}} \Psi.
\tag{14}

This work is inspired by the idea of representing the wave function with
a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM), presented recently by <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/355/6325/602" target="_blank">G. Carleo and M. Troyer, Science <b>355</b>, Issue 6325, pp. 602-606 (2017)</a>. They
named such a wave function/network a <em>neural network quantum state</em> (NQS). In their article they apply it to the quantum mechanical
spin lattice systems of the Ising model and Heisenberg model, with
encouraging results. See also the recent work by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.14282" target="_blank">Adams et al.</a>.
