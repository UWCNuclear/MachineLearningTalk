    "\n",
    "The approaches to machine learning are many, but are often split into two main categories. \n",
    "In *supervised learning* we know the answer to a problem,\n",
    "and let the computer deduce the logic behind it. On the other hand, *unsupervised learning*\n",
    "is a method for finding patterns and relationship in data sets without any prior knowledge of the system.\n",
    "Some authours also operate with a third category, namely *reinforcement learning*. This is a paradigm \n",
    "of learning inspired by behavioural psychology, where learning is achieved by trial-and-error, \n",
    "solely from rewards and punishment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to categorize machine learning tasks is to consider the desired output of a system.\n",
    "Some of the most common tasks are:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Classification: Outputs are divided into two or more classes. The goal is to   produce a model that assigns inputs into one of these classes. An example is to identify  digits based on pictures of hand-written ones. Classification is typically supervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Regression: Finding a functional relationship between an input data set and a reference data set.   The goal is to construct a function that maps input data to continuous output values.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Clustering: Data are divided into groups with certain common traits, without knowing the different groups beforehand.  It is thus a form of unsupervised learning.\n",

    "## ML in Nuclear Physics, Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "The large amount of degrees of freedom pertain to both theory and experiment in nuclear physics. With increasingly complicated experiments that produce large amounts data, automated classification of events becomes increasingly important. Here, deep learning methods offer a plethora of interesting research avenues. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Reconstruction of particle trajectories or classification of events are typical examples where ML methods are being used. However, since these data can often be extremely noisy, the precision necessary for discovery in physics requires algorithmic improvements. Research along such directions, interfacing nuclear physics with AI/ML is expected to play a significant role in physics discoveries related to new facilities.  The treatment of corrupted data in imaging and image processing is also a relevant topic. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Design of detectors represents an important area of applications for ML/AI methods in nuclear physics.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Many of the above classification problems have also have direct application in theoretical nuclear physics (including Lattice QCD calculations).\n",
    "\n",
    "## More examples\n",
    "\n",
    "* An important application of AI/L methods is to improve the estimation of bias or uncertainty due to the introduction of or lack of physical constraints in various theoretical models.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In theory, we expect to use AI/ML algorithms and methods to improve our knowledged about  correlations of physical model parameters in data for quantum many-body systems. Deep learning methods like Boltzmann machines and various types of Recurrent Neural networks show great promise in circumventing the exploding dimensionalities encountered in quantum mechanical many-body studies. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Merging a frequentist approach (the standard path in ML theory) with a Bayesian approach, has the potential to infer better probabilitity distributions and error estimates. As an example, methods for fast Monte-Carlo- based Bayesian computation of nuclear density functionals show great promise in providing a better understanding \n",

    "\n",
    "When you hear phrases like **predictions and estimations** and\n",
    "**correlations and causations**, what do you think of?  May be you think\n",
    "of the difference between classifying new data points and generating\n",
    "new data points.\n",
    "Or perhaps you consider that correlations represent some kind of symmetric statements like\n",
    "if $A$ is correlated with $B$, then $B$ is correlated with\n",

    "\n",
    "These concepts are in some sense the difference between machine\n",
    "learning and statistics. In machine learning and prediction based\n",
    "tasks, we are often interested in developing algorithms that are\n",
    "capable of learning patterns from given data in an automated fashion,\n",
    "and then using these learned patterns to make predictions or\n",
    "assessments of newly given data. In many cases, our primary concern\n",
    "is the quality of the predictions or assessments, and we are less\n",
    "concerned about the underlying patterns that were learned in order\n",
    "to make these predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In machine learning we normally use [a so-called frequentist approach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequentist_inference),\n",
    "where the aim is to make predictions and find correlations. We focus\n",
    "less on for example extracting a probability distribution function (PDF). The PDF can be\n",
    "used in turn to make estimations and find causations such as given $A$\n",
    "what is the likelihood of finding $B$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are the basic ingredients?\n",
    "Almost every problem in ML and data science starts with the same ingredients:\n",
    "* The dataset $\\mathbf{x}$ (could be some observable quantity of the system we are studying)\n",
    "\n",
    "* A model which is a function of a set of parameters $\\mathbf{\\alpha}$ that relates to the dataset, say a likelihood  function $p(\\mathbf{x}\\vert \\mathbf{\\alpha})$ or just a simple model $f(\\mathbf{\\alpha})$\n",
    "\n",
    "* A so-called **loss/cost/risk** function $\\mathcal{C} (\\mathbf{x}, f(\\mathbf{\\alpha}))$ which allows us to decide how well our model represents the dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "We seek to minimize the function $\\mathcal{C} (\\mathbf{x}, f(\\mathbf{\\alpha}))$ by finding the parameter values which minimize $\\mathcal{C}$. This leads to  various minimization algorithms. It may surprise many, but at the heart of all machine learning algortihms there is an optimization problem.\n",

    "## Neural network types\n",
    "An artificial neural network (NN), is a computational model that consists of layers of connected neurons, or *nodes*. \n",
    "It is supposed to mimic a biological nervous system by letting each neuron interact with other neurons\n",
    "by sending signals in the form of mathematical functions between layers. \n",
    "A wide variety of different NNs have\n",

    "## Why Machine Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "The traditional Monte Carlo event selection process does not have a\n",
    "well-defined method to quantify the effectiveness of the event\n",
    "selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, the selection task normally produces  a binary result only, either\n",
    "a **good** or **bad** fit to the event of interest. A **bad**\n",
    "fit is then assumed to be a different event type, and is removed from\n",
    "the analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "In a broader perspective, an\n",
    "unsupervised classification algorithm would offer the possibility to\n",
    "*discover* rare events which may not be expected or are\n",
    "overlooked. These events would likely be filtered out using the\n",
    "traditional methods. From a practical point of view, compared to\n",
    "supervised learning, it also avoids the necessary labeling task of the\n",
    "learning set events, which is error prone and time consuming.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Machine Learning for Experimental Analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "The $\\chi^2$ approach used in the traditional analysis performed on\n",
    "the $^{46}$Ar data is extremely expensive from a computational stand\n",
    "because it involves the simulation of thousands of tracks for each\n",
    "recorded event.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "These events are in turn simulated for each iteration of the Monte\n",
    "Carlo fitting sequence.  Even though the reaction of interest in the\n",
    "above experiment had the largest cross section (elastic scattering),\n",
    "the time spent on Monte Carlo fitting of *all* of the events\n",
    "produced in the experiment was the largest computational bottleneck in\n",
    "the analysis. In the case of an experiment where the reaction of\n",
    "interest would represent less than a few percent of the total cross\n",
    "section, this procedure would become highly inefficient and\n",
    "prohibitive. Adding to this the large amount of data produced in this\n",
    "experiment (with even larger data sets expected in future\n",
    "experiments), the analysis simply begs for more efficient analysis\n",
    "tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## More arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "The computationally expensive fitting procedure\n",
    "would be applied to every event, instead of the few percent of the\n",
    "events that are of interest for the analysis.  An unsupervised ML\n",
    "algorithm able to separate the data without *a priori* knowledge\n",
    "of the different types of events increases the efficiency of the\n",
    "analysis tremendously, and allows the downstream analysis to\n",
    "concentrate on the fitting efforts only on events of interest. In\n",
    "addition, the clustering allows for more exploration of the data,\n",

    "stacked layer-wise to build deep neural networks that capture\n",
    "complicated statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The original RBMs had just one visible layer and a hidden layer, but\n",
    "recently so-called Gaussian-binary RBMs have gained quite some\n",
    "popularity in imaging since they are capable of modeling continuous\n",

This might for example be the pixels of an image, the spin values of the Ising model, or coefficients representing speech.\n",
