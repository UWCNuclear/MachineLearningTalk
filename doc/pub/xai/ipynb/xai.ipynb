    "of experimental and theoretical physics to facilitate discovery,\n",

    "\n",
    "These techniques are proving to be powerful tools for advancing our\n",
    "understanding; however, they are not without significant\n",
    "challenges. The theoretical foundations of many tools, such as deep\n",
    "learning, are poorly understood, resulting in the use of techniques\n",
    "whose behavior (and misbehavior) is difficult to predict and\n",
    "understand. Similarly, physicists typically use general AI techniques\n",
    "that are not tailored to the needs of the experimental and theoretical\n",
    "work being done. Thus, many opportunities exist for major advances\n",
    "both in physical discovery using AI and in the theory of\n",
    "AI. Furthermore, there are tremendous opportunities for these fields\n",
    "to inform each other, for example, in creating machine learning- based\n",

    "## A new world\n",

    "## Types of Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "The approaches to machine learning are many, but are often split into two main categories. \n",
    "In *supervised learning* we know the answer to a problem,\n",
    "and let the computer deduce the logic behind it. On the other hand, *unsupervised learning*\n",
    "is a method for finding patterns and relationship in data sets without any prior knowledge of the system.\n",
    "Some authours also operate with a third category, namely *reinforcement learning*. This is a paradigm \n",
    "of learning inspired by behavioural psychology, where learning is achieved by trial-and-error, \n",
    "solely from rewards and punishment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to categorize machine learning tasks is to consider the desired output of a system.\n",
    "Some of the most common tasks are:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Classification: Outputs are divided into two or more classes. The goal is to   produce a model that assigns inputs into one of these classes. An example is to identify  digits based on pictures of hand-written ones. Classification is typically supervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Regression: Finding a functional relationship between an input data set and a reference data set.   The goal is to construct a function that maps input data to continuous output values.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Clustering: Data are divided into groups with certain common traits, without knowing the different groups beforehand.  It is thus a form of unsupervised learning.\n",

    "## ML in Physics, Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "The large amount of degrees of freedom pertain to both theory and experiment in physics. With increasingly complicated experiments that produce large amounts data, automated classification of events becomes increasingly important. Here, deep learning methods offer a plethora of interesting research avenues. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Reconstruction of particle trajectories or classification of events are typical examples where ML methods are being used. However, since these data can often be extremely noisy, the precision necessary for discovery in physics requires algorithmic improvements. Research along such directions, interfacing nuclear physics with AI/ML is expected to play a significant role in physics discoveries related to new facilities.  The treatment of corrupted data in imaging and image processing is also a relevant topic. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Design of detectors represents an important area of applications for ML/AI methods in subnuclear physics.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Many of the above classification problems have also have direct application in theoretical physics.\n",
    "\n",
    "## More examples\n",
    "\n",
    "* An important application of AI/L methods is to improve the estimation of bias or uncertainty due to the introduction of or lack of physical constraints in various theoretical models.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In theory, we expect to use AI/ML algorithms and methods to improve our knowledged about  correlations of physical model parameters in data for quantum many-body systems. Deep learning methods like Boltzmann machines and various types of Recurrent Neural networks show great promise in circumventing the exploding dimensionalities encountered in quantum mechanical many-body studies. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Merging a frequentist approach (the standard path in ML theory) with a Bayesian approach, has the potential to infer better probabilitity distributions and error estimates. As an example, methods for fast Monte-Carlo- based Bayesian computation of nuclear density functionals show great promise in providing a better understanding \n",

    "## A Frequentist approach to data analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "When you hear phrases like **predictions and estimations** and\n",
    "**correlations and causations**, what do you think of?  May be you think\n",
    "of the difference between classifying new data points and generating\n",
    "new data points.\n",
    "Or perhaps you consider that correlations represent some kind of symmetric statements like\n",
    "if $A$ is correlated with $B$, then $B$ is correlated with\n",
    "$A$. Causation on the other hand is directional, that is if $A$ causes $B$, $B$ does not\n",
    "necessarily cause $A$.\n",
    "\n",
    "These concepts are in some sense the difference between machine\n",
    "learning and statistics. In machine learning and prediction based\n",
    "tasks, we are often interested in developing algorithms that are\n",
    "capable of learning patterns from given data in an automated fashion,\n",
    "and then using these learned patterns to make predictions or\n",
    "assessments of newly given data. In many cases, our primary concern\n",
    "is the quality of the predictions or assessments, and we are less\n",
    "concerned about the underlying patterns that were learned in order\n",
    "to make these predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In machine learning we normally use [a so-called frequentist approach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequentist_inference),\n",

    "\n",
    "* A model which is a function of a set of parameters $\\mathbf{\\alpha}$ that relates to the dataset, say a likelihood  function $p(\\mathbf{x}\\vert \\mathbf{\\alpha})$ or just a simple model $f(\\mathbf{\\alpha})$\n",
    "\n",
    "* A so-called **loss/cost/risk** function $\\mathcal{C} (\\mathbf{x}, f(\\mathbf{\\alpha}))$ which allows us to decide how well our model represents the dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "We seek to minimize the function $\\mathcal{C} (\\mathbf{x}, f(\\mathbf{\\alpha}))$ by finding the parameter values which minimize $\\mathcal{C}$. This leads to  various minimization algorithms.
