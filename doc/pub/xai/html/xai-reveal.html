Quantum Computing and Machine Learning are two of the most promising
approaches for studying complex physical systems where several length
and energy scales are involved. Traditional many-particle methods,
either quantum mechanical or classical ones, face huge dimensionality
problems when applied to studies of systems with many interacting
particles.

<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-normal">
<b></b>
<p>
Artificial intelligence-based techniques, particularly in machine
learning and optimization, are increasingly being used in many areas
of experimental and theoretical physics to facilitate discovery,
accelerate data analysis and modeling efforts, and bridge different
physical and temporal scales in numerical models.

<p>
These techniques are proving to be powerful tools for advancing our
understanding; however, they are not without significant
challenges. The theoretical foundations of many tools, such as deep
learning, are poorly understood, resulting in the use of techniques
whose behavior (and misbehavior) is difficult to predict and
understand. Similarly, physicists typically use general AI techniques
that are not tailored to the needs of the experimental and theoretical
work being done. Thus, many opportunities exist for major advances
both in physical discovery using AI and in the theory of
AI. Furthermore, there are tremendous opportunities for these fields
to inform each other, for example, in creating machine learning- based
methods that must obey certain constraints by design, such as the
conservation of mass, momentum and energy.

<h2 id="___sec8">Types of Machine Learning </h2>

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-normal">
<b></b>
<p>
The approaches to machine learning are many, but are often split into two main categories. 
In <em>supervised learning</em> we know the answer to a problem,
and let the computer deduce the logic behind it. On the other hand, <em>unsupervised learning</em>
is a method for finding patterns and relationship in data sets without any prior knowledge of the system.
Some authours also operate with a third category, namely <em>reinforcement learning</em>. This is a paradigm 
of learning inspired by behavioural psychology, where learning is achieved by trial-and-error, 
solely from rewards and punishment.

<p>
Another way to categorize machine learning tasks is to consider the desired output of a system.
Some of the most common tasks are:

<ul>

<p><li> Classification: Outputs are divided into two or more classes. The goal is to   produce a model that assigns inputs into one of these classes. An example is to identify  digits based on pictures of hand-written ones. Classification is typically supervised learning.</li>

<p><li> Regression: Finding a functional relationship between an input data set and a reference data set.   The goal is to construct a function that maps input data to continuous output values.</li>

<p><li> Clustering: Data are divided into groups with certain common traits, without knowing the different groups beforehand.  It is thus a form of unsupervised learning.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="___sec10">ML in Physics, Examples </h2>

<p>
The large amount of degrees of freedom pertain to both theory and experiment in physics. With increasingly complicated experiments that produce large amounts data, automated classification of events becomes increasingly important. Here, deep learning methods offer a plethora of interesting research avenues. 

<ul>
<p><li> Reconstruction of particle trajectories or classification of events are typical examples where ML methods are being used. However, since these data can often be extremely noisy, the precision necessary for discovery in physics requires algorithmic improvements. Research along such directions, interfacing nuclear physics with AI/ML is expected to play a significant role in physics discoveries related to new facilities.  The treatment of corrupted data in imaging and image processing is also a relevant topic.</li> 
<p><li> Design of detectors represents an important area of applications for ML/AI methods in subnuclear physics.</li>
<p><li> Many of the above classification problems have also have direct application in theoretical physics.</li>
</ul>
</section>


<section>
<h2 id="___sec11">More examples  </h2>

<ul>
<p><li> An important application of AI/L methods is to improve the estimation of bias or uncertainty due to the introduction of or lack of physical constraints in various theoretical models.</li>
<p><li> In theory, we expect to use AI/ML algorithms and methods to improve our knowledged about  correlations of physical model parameters in data for quantum many-body systems. Deep learning methods like Boltzmann machines and various types of Recurrent Neural networks show great promise in circumventing the exploding dimensionalities encountered in quantum mechanical many-body studies.</li> 
<p><li> Merging a frequentist approach (the standard path in ML theory) with a Bayesian approach, has the potential to infer better probabilitity distributions and error estimates. As an example, methods for fast Monte-Carlo- based Bayesian computation of nuclear density functionals show great promise in providing a better understanding</li> 
<p><li> Machine Learning and Quantum Computing is a very interesting avenue to explore and a hot research topic.</li>

<h2 id="___sec16">What are the Machine Learning calculations here based on? </h2>

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-normal">
<b></b>
<p>
This work is inspired by the idea of representing the wave function with
a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM), presented recently by <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/355/6325/602" target="_blank">G. Carleo and M. Troyer, Science <b>355</b>, Issue 6325, pp. 602-606 (2017)</a>. They
named such a wave function/network a <em>neural network quantum state</em> (NQS). In their article they apply it to the quantum mechanical
spin lattice systems of the Ising model and Heisenberg model, with
encouraging results. See also the recent work by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.14282" target="_blank">Adams et al.</a>.

<h2 id="___sec17">A Frequentist approach to data analysis  </h2>

<p>
When you hear phrases like <b>predictions and estimations</b> and
<b>correlations and causations</b>, what do you think of?  May be you think
of the difference between classifying new data points and generating
new data points.
Or perhaps you consider that correlations represent some kind of symmetric statements like
if \( A \) is correlated with \( B \), then \( B \) is correlated with
\( A \). Causation on the other hand is directional, that is if \( A \) causes \( B \), \( B \) does not
necessarily cause \( A \).

<p>
These concepts are in some sense the difference between machine
learning and statistics. In machine learning and prediction based
tasks, we are often interested in developing algorithms that are
capable of learning patterns from given data in an automated fashion,
and then using these learned patterns to make predictions or
assessments of newly given data. In many cases, our primary concern
is the quality of the predictions or assessments, and we are less
concerned about the underlying patterns that were learned in order
to make these predictions.

<p>
In machine learning we normally use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequentist_inference" target="_blank">a so-called frequentist approach</a>,
where the aim is to make predictions and find correlations. We focus
less on for example extracting a probability distribution function (PDF). The PDF can be
used in turn to make estimations and find causations such as given \( A \)
what is the likelihood of finding \( B \).
</section>


<section>
<h2 id="___sec18">What are the basic ingredients? </h2>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-normal">
<b></b>
<p>
Almost every problem in ML and data science starts with the same ingredients:

<ul>
<p><li> The dataset \( \mathbf{x} \) (could be some observable quantity of the system we are studying)</li>
<p><li> A model which is a function of a set of parameters \( \mathbf{\alpha} \) that relates to the dataset, say a likelihood  function \( p(\mathbf{x}\vert \mathbf{\alpha}) \) or just a simple model \( f(\mathbf{\alpha}) \)</li>
<p><li> A so-called <b>loss/cost/risk</b> function \( \mathcal{C} (\mathbf{x}, f(\mathbf{\alpha})) \) which allows us to decide how well our model represents the dataset.</li> 
</ul>
<p>

We seek to minimize the function \( \mathcal{C} (\mathbf{x}, f(\mathbf{\alpha})) \) by finding the parameter values which minimize \( \mathcal{C} \). This leads to  various minimization algorithms. It may surprise many, but at the heart of all machine learning algortihms there is an optimization problem.

<h2 id="___sec19">Artificial neurons  </h2>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-normal">
<b></b>
<p>
The field of artificial neural networks has a long history of
development, and is closely connected with the advancement of computer
science and computers in general. A model of artificial neurons was
first developed by McCulloch and Pitts in 1943 to study signal
processing in the brain and has later been refined by others. The
general idea is to mimic neural networks in the human brain, which is
composed of billions of neurons that communicate with each other by
sending electrical signals.  Each neuron accumulates its incoming
signals, which must exceed an activation threshold to yield an
output. If the threshold is not overcome, the neuron remains inactive,
i.e. has zero output.

<p>
This behaviour has inspired a simple mathematical model for an artificial neuron.

<p>&nbsp;<br>
$$
 y = f\left(\sum_{i=1}^n w_ix_i\right) = f(u)
$$
<p>&nbsp;<br>

Here, the output \( y \) of the neuron is the value of its activation function, which have as input
a weighted sum of signals \( x_i, \dots ,x_n \) received by \( n \) other neurons.

It is supposed to mimic a biological nervous system by letting each neuron interact with other neurons
by sending signals in the form of mathematical functions between layers. 
A wide variety of different NNs have
been developed, but most of them consist of an input layer, an output layer and eventual layers in-between, called
<em>hidden layers</em>. All layers can contain an arbitrary number of nodes, and each connection between two nodes
is associated with a weight variable.

<h2 id="___sec23">The first system: electrons in a harmonic oscillator trap in two dimensions </h2>

<p>
The Hamiltonian of the quantum dot is given by
<p>&nbsp;<br>
$$ \hat{H} = \hat{H}_0 + \hat{V}, 
$$
<p>&nbsp;<br>

where \( \hat{H}_0 \) is the many-body HO Hamiltonian, and \( \hat{V} \) is the
inter-electron Coulomb interactions. In dimensionless units,
<p>&nbsp;<br>
$$ \hat{V}= \sum_{i < j}^N \frac{1}{r_{ij}},
$$
<p>&nbsp;<br>

with \( r_{ij}=\sqrt{\mathbf{r}_i^2 - \mathbf{r}_j^2} \).

<p>
This leads to the  separable Hamiltonian, with the relative motion part given by (\( r_{ij}=r \))
<p>&nbsp;<br>
$$ 
\hat{H}_r=-\nabla^2_r + \frac{1}{4}\omega^2r^2+ \frac{1}{r},
$$
<p>&nbsp;<br>

plus a standard Harmonic Oscillator problem  for the center-of-mass motion.
This system has analytical solutions in two and three dimensions (<a href="https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.48.3561" target="_blank">M. Taut 1993 and 1994</a>).

Given a hamiltonian \( H \) and a trial wave function \( \Psi_T \), the variational principle states that the expectation value of \( \langle H \rangle \), defined through

<p>
We want to perform  a Variational Monte Carlo calculation of the ground state of two electrons in a quantum dot well with different oscillator energies, assuming total spin \( S=0 \).
Our trial wave function has the following form
<p>&nbsp;<br>
$$
\begin{equation}
   \psi_{T}(\boldsymbol{r}_1,\boldsymbol{r}_2) = 
   C\exp{\left(-\alpha_1\omega(r_1^2+r_2^2)/2\right)}

$$
<p>&nbsp;<br>

where the variables \( \alpha_1 \) and \( \alpha_2 \) represent our variational parameters.

<p>
Why does the trial function look like this? How did we get there? <b>This is one of our main motivations</b> for switching to
Machine Learning.


</div>
</section>


<section>
<h2 id="___sec29">The correlation part of the wave function </h2>

<p>
To find an ansatz for the correlated part of the wave function, it is useful to rewrite the two-particle
local energy in terms of the relative and center-of-mass motion.
Let us denote the distance between the two electrons as
\( r_{12} \). We omit the center-of-mass motion since we are only interested in the case when
\( r_{12} \rightarrow 0 \). The contribution from the center-of-mass (CoM) variable \( \boldsymbol{R}_{\mathrm{CoM}} \)
gives only a finite contribution.
We focus only on the terms that are relevant for \( r_{12} \) and for three dimensions. The relevant local energy operator becomes then (with \( l=0 \))
<p>&nbsp;<br>
$$
\lim_{r_{12} \rightarrow 0}E_L(R)=
    \frac{1}{{\cal R}_T(r_{12})}\left(-2\frac{d^2}{dr_{ij}^2}-\frac{4}{r_{ij}}\frac{d}{dr_{ij}}+
\frac{2}{r_{ij}}\right){\cal R}_T(r_{12}).
$$
<p>&nbsp;<br>

In order to avoid divergencies when \( r_{12}\rightarrow 0 \) we obtain  the so-called <b>cusp</b> condition
<p>&nbsp;<br>
$$
\frac{d {\cal R}_T(r_{12})}{dr_{12}} = \frac{1}{2}
{\cal R}_T(r_{12})\qquad r_{12}\to 0
$$
<p>&nbsp;<br>
</section>


<section>
<h2 id="___sec30">Resulting ansatz </h2>
The above  results in
<p>&nbsp;<br>
$$
{\cal R}_T  \propto \exp{(r_{ij}/2)}, 
$$
<p>&nbsp;<br>

for anti-parallel spins and 
<p>&nbsp;<br>
$$
{\cal R}_T  \propto \exp{(r_{ij}/4)}, 
$$
<p>&nbsp;<br>

for anti-parallel spins. 
This is the so-called cusp condition for the relative motion, resulting in a minimal requirement
for the correlation part of the wave fuction.
For general systems containing more than say two electrons, we have this
condition for each electron pair \( ij \).

<section>
<h2 id="___sec31">Energy derivatives </h2>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-normal">
<b></b>
<p>
To find the derivatives of the local energy expectation value as function of the variational parameters, we can use the chain rule and the hermiticity of the Hamiltonian.

<p>
Let us define (with the notation \( \langle E[\boldsymbol{\alpha}]\rangle =\langle  E_L\rangle \))
<p>&nbsp;<br>
$$
\bar{E}_{\alpha_i}=\frac{d\langle  E_L\rangle}{d\alpha_i},
$$
<p>&nbsp;<br>

as the derivative of the energy with respect to the variational parameter \( \alpha_i \)
We define also the derivative of the trial function (skipping the subindex \( T \)) as 
<p>&nbsp;<br>
$$
\bar{\Psi}_{i}=\frac{d\Psi}{d\alpha_i}.
$$
<p>&nbsp;<br>
</div>
</section>


<section>
<h2 id="___sec32">Derivatives of the local energy </h2>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-normal">
<b></b>
<p>
The elements of the gradient of the local energy are then (using the chain rule and the hermiticity of the Hamiltonian)
<p>&nbsp;<br>
$$
\bar{E}_{i}= 2\left( \langle \frac{\bar{\Psi}_{i}}{\Psi}E_L\rangle -\langle \frac{\bar{\Psi}_{i}}{\Psi}\rangle\langle E_L \rangle\right).
$$
<p>&nbsp;<br>

From a computational point of view it means that you need to compute the expectation values of 
<p>&nbsp;<br>
$$
\langle \frac{\bar{\Psi}_{i}}{\Psi}E_L\rangle,
$$
<p>&nbsp;<br>

and
<p>&nbsp;<br>
$$
\langle \frac{\bar{\Psi}_{i}}{\Psi}\rangle\langle E_L\rangle
$$
<p>&nbsp;<br>

These integrals are evaluted using MC intergration (with all its possible error sources). 
We can then use methods like stochastic gradient or other minimization methods to find the optimal variational parameters (I don't discuss this topic here, but these methods are very important in ML).

<h2 id="___sec33">Why Boltzmann machines? </h2>

<p>
What is known as restricted Boltzmann Machines (RMB) have received a
lot of attention lately.  One of the major reasons is that they can be
stacked layer-wise to build deep neural networks that capture
complicated statistics.

<p>
The original RBMs had just one visible layer and a hidden layer, but
recently so-called Gaussian-binary RBMs have gained quite some
popularity in imaging since they are capable of modeling continuous
data that are common to natural images.

<p>
Furthermore, they have been used to solve complicated quantum
mechanical many-particle problems or classical statistical physics
problems like the Ising and Potts classes of models.

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-normal">

<p>
A standard BM network is divided into a set of observable and visible units \( \hat{x} \) and a set of unknown hidden units/nodes \( \hat{h} \).
</div>

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-normal">
<b></b>
<p>
Additionally there can be bias nodes for the hidden and visible layers. These biases are normally set to \( 1 \).
</div>

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-normal">
<b></b>
<p>
BMs are stackable, meaning we can train a BM which serves as input to another BM. We can construct deep networks for learning complex PDFs. The layers can be trained one after another, a feature which makes them popular in deep learning
</div>

<p>
However, they are often hard to train. This leads to the introduction of so-called restricted BMs, or RBMS.
Here we take away all lateral connections between nodes in the visible layer as well as connections between nodes in the hidden layer. The network is illustrated in the figure below.

</section>


<section>
<h2 id="___sec36">The network </h2>

<p>
<b>The network layers</b>:

<ol>
 <p><li> A function \( \mathbf{x} \) that represents the visible layer, a vector of \( M \) elements (nodes). This layer represents both what the RBM might be given as training input, and what we want it to be able to reconstruct. This might for example be the pixels of an image, the spin values of the Ising model, or coefficients representing speech.</li>
 <p><li> The function \( \mathbf{h} \) represents the hidden, or latent, layer. A vector of \( N \) elements (nodes). Also called "feature detectors".</li>
</ol>
</section>


<section>
<h2 id="___sec37">Goals </h2>

<p>
The goal of the hidden layer is to increase the model's expressive
power. We encode complex interactions between visible variables by
introducing additional, hidden variables that interact with visible
degrees of freedom in a simple manner, yet still reproduce the complex
correlations between visible degrees in the data once marginalized
over (integrated out).

<p>
<b>The network parameters, to be optimized/learned</b>:

<ol>
 <p><li> \( \mathbf{a} \) represents the visible bias, a vector of same length as \( \mathbf{x} \).</li>
 <p><li> \( \mathbf{b} \) represents the hidden bias, a vector of same lenght as \( \mathbf{h} \).</li>
 <p><li> \( W \) represents the interaction weights, a matrix of size \( M\times N \).</li>
</ol>
</section>


<section>
<h2 id="___sec38">Joint distribution </h2>

<p>
The restricted Boltzmann machine is described by a Boltzmann distribution
<p>&nbsp;<br>
$$
\begin{align}
	P_{rbm}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{h}) = \frac{1}{Z} e^{-\frac{1}{T_0}E(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{h})},
\tag{2}
\end{align}
$$
<p>&nbsp;<br>

where \( Z \) is the normalization constant or partition function, defined as 
<p>&nbsp;<br>
$$
\begin{align}
	Z = \int \int e^{-\frac{1}{T_0}E(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{h})} d\mathbf{x} d\mathbf{h}.
\tag{3}
\end{align}
$$
<p>&nbsp;<br>

It is common to ignore \( T_0 \) by setting it to one.
</section>


<section>
<h2 id="___sec39">Defining different types of RBMs </h2>

<p>
There are different variants of RBMs, and the differences lie in the types of visible and hidden units we choose as well as in the implementation of the energy function \( E(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{h}) \).

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-normal">
<b>Binary-Binary RBM:</b>
<p>
RBMs were first developed using binary units in both the visible and hidden layer. The corresponding energy function is defined as follows:
<p>&nbsp;<br>
$$
\begin{align}
	E(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{h}) = - \sum_i^M x_i a_i- \sum_j^N b_j h_j - \sum_{i,j}^{M,N} x_i w_{ij} h_j,
\tag{4}
\end{align}
$$
<p>&nbsp;<br>

where the binary values taken on by the nodes are most commonly 0 and 1.
</div>

<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-normal">
<b>Gaussian-Binary RBM:</b>
<p>
Another variant is the RBM where the visible units are Gaussian while the hidden units remain binary:
<p>&nbsp;<br>
$$
\begin{align}
	E(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{h}) = \sum_i^M \frac{(x_i - a_i)^2}{2\sigma_i^2} - \sum_j^N b_j h_j - \sum_{i,j}^{M,N} \frac{x_i w_{ij} h_j}{\sigma_i^2}. 
\tag{5}
\end{align}
$$
<p>&nbsp;<br>
</div>
</section>


<section>
<h2 id="___sec40">Representing the wave function </h2>

<p>
The wavefunction should be a probability amplitude depending on \( \boldsymbol{x} \). The RBM model is given by the joint distribution of \( \boldsymbol{x} \) and \( \boldsymbol{h} \)
<p>&nbsp;<br>
$$
\begin{align}
	F_{rbm}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{h}) = \frac{1}{Z} e^{-\frac{1}{T_0}E(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{h})}.
\tag{6}
\end{align}
$$
<p>&nbsp;<br>

To find the marginal distribution of \( \boldsymbol{x} \) we set:
<p>&nbsp;<br>
$$
\begin{align}
	F_{rbm}(\mathbf{x}) &= \sum_\mathbf{h} F_{rbm}(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{h}) 
\tag{7}\\
				&= \frac{1}{Z}\sum_\mathbf{h} e^{-E(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{h})}.
\tag{8}
\end{align}
$$
<p>&nbsp;<br>

Now this is what we use to represent the wave function, calling it a neural-network quantum state (NQS)
<p>&nbsp;<br>
$$
\begin{align}
	\Psi (\mathbf{x}) &= F_{rbm}(\mathbf{x}) 
\tag{9}\\
	&= \frac{1}{Z}\sum_{\boldsymbol{h}} e^{-E(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{h})} 
\tag{10}\\
	&= \frac{1}{Z} \sum_{\{h_j\}} e^{-\sum_i^M \frac{(x_i - a_i)^2}{2\sigma^2} + \sum_j^N b_j h_j + \sum_{i,j}^{M,N} \frac{x_i w_{ij} h_j}{\sigma^2}} 
\tag{11}\\
	&= \frac{1}{Z} e^{-\sum_i^M \frac{(x_i - a_i)^2}{2\sigma^2}} \prod_j^N (1 + e^{b_j + \sum_i^M \frac{x_i w_{ij}}{\sigma^2}}). 
\tag{12}\\
\tag{13}
\end{align}
$$

<section>
<h2 id="___sec41">Choose the cost/loss function </h2>

<p>
Now we don't necessarily have training data (unless we generate it by
using some other method). However, what we do have is the variational
principle which allows us to obtain the ground state wave function by
minimizing the expectation value of the energy of a trial wavefunction
(corresponding to the untrained NQS). Similarly to the traditional
variational Monte Carlo method then, it is the local energy we wish to
minimize. The gradient to use for the stochastic gradient descent
procedure is

<p>&nbsp;<br>
$$
\begin{align}
	\frac{\partial \langle E_L \rangle}{\partial \theta_i}
	= 2(\langle E_L \frac{1}{\Psi}\frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial \theta_i} \rangle - \langle E_L \rangle \langle \frac{1}{\Psi}\frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial \theta_i} \rangle ),
\tag{14}
\end{align}
$$
<p>&nbsp;<br>

where the local energy is given by
<p>&nbsp;<br>
$$
\begin{align}
	E_L = \frac{1}{\Psi} \hat{\mathbf{H}} \Psi.

<h2 id="___sec48">And then Quantum Boltzmann Machines </h2>

<p>
Quantum Boltzmann Machines (QBMs) are a natural adaption of BMs to the
quantum computing framework. Instead of an energy function with nodes
being represented by binary spin values, QBMs define the underlying
network using a Hermitian operator, a parameterized Hamiltonian

<p>&nbsp;<br>
$$
\begin{equation*}
    H_{\theta}=\sum_{i=0}^{p-1}\theta_ih_i,
\end{equation*}
$$
<p>&nbsp;<br>

with \( \theta\in\mathbb{R}^p \) and \( h_i=\bigotimes_{j=0}^{n-1}\sigma_{j, i} \) for \( \sigma_{j, i} \) acting on the \( j^{\text{th}} \) qubit.

<p>
The network nodes are characterized by the Pauli matrices \( \sigma_{j, i} \).

<p>
It should be noted that the qubits which determine the model output are referred to as visible and those which act as latent variables as hidden qubits.
The aim of the model is to learn Hamiltonian parameters such that the resulting Gibbs state reflects a given target system.
In contrast to Boltzmann Machines, this framework allows the use of quantum structures which are potentially inaccessible classically.
<b>Equivalently to the classical model, QBMs are suitable for discriminative as well as generative learning.</b>

<h2 id="___sec50">Conclusions and where do we stand </h2>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-normal">
<b></b>
<ul>
<p><li> Lots of experimental analysis coming, see for example <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02757" target="_blank">Unsupervised Learning for Identifying Events in Active Target Experiments by Solli et al.</a> as well references and examples in  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.05422" target="_blank">Report from the A.I. For Nuclear Physics  Workshop by Bedaque et al.</a>.</li>
<p><li> Extension of the work of <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/355/6325/602" target="_blank">G. Carleo and M. Troyer, Science <b>355</b>, Issue 6325, pp. 602-606 (2017)</a> gives excellent results for two-electron systems as well as good agreement with standard VMC calculations for \( N=6 \) and \( N=12 \) electrons.</li>
<p><li> Promising results. Next step is to use trial wave function in final Green's function Monte Carlo calculations.</li> 
<p><li> Minimization problem can be tricky.</li>
<p><li> Can we use ML to find out which correlations are relevant and thereby diminish the dimensionality problem in say CC or SRG theories?</li> 
<p><li> Quantum Boltzmann Machines (QBMs) to devise better quantum gates for quantum computations and many more exciting topics</li>
<p><li> QBMs can be utilized to train models for data from experiments with quantum systems. They might be employed for combinatorial optimization. Classical BMs have been investigated in this context and developing and analyzing quantum algorithms for combinatorial optimization is an active area of research.</li>
<p><li> All in all, there are many possible applications which still have to be explored with many more exciting research avenues. See for example <a href="https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.99.032331" target="_blank">Maria Schuld et al on evaluating analytic gradients on quantum hardware</a>.</li>
