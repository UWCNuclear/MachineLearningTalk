    "\n",
    "A grand challenge of quantum information science is to develop systems and algorithms that will be minimally negatively affected by noise or would even take advantage of it. The Institute for Quantum Computing and Control (IQC2) at Michigan State University will deliver means toward meeting this challenge, raising quantum information science to the next level. The physicists, engineers, and chemists in the Institute will develop means to measure the spectral and statistical properties of noise in current quantum computing devices, while mathematicians and theoretical quantum information scientists will build models for the statistics of the noise and develop novel methods for engineering entanglement and coherence using noise. The results will enable new sensor technologies based on a broad spectrum of quantum systems that include superconducting circuits and resonators and trapped electrons, and taking advantage of new platforms such as isotopically pure diamond. In parallel, understanding noise will allow our experts in computational data science and machine learning to deliver next-generation hybrid quantum-classical algorithms for optimization, quantum machine learning, and the simulation of chemical structure and nuclear matter. Our tightly knit interdisciplinary team, along with our strategic partnerships with industry, national labs and startup companies, is well positioned to educate, develop and deliver the next-generation US quantum workforce.\n",

    "\n",
    "If funded, we may expect if fully funded over all years something like\n",
    "15 student years and 7.5 PD years which would benefit FRIB activities\n",
    "(theory).  Most likely this would amount to something between 1.7MUSD\n",
    "and 1.9 MUSD. From the mail which came via the CNS, this could amount\n",
    "to a 20kUSD per year contribution on the 250kUSD for the center.\n",
    "\n",
    "Presently from the FRIB side this is mainly a theory-based initiative. \n",
    "We have not discussed how Nuclear Experiment can be involved (see also the document of [Cloet et al](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.05453), Opportunities for Nuclear Physics and Quantum Information Science.\n",

    "\n",
    "## For discussion\n",
    "* Is this of interest to us as a lab? \n",
    "\n",
    "* There is a lot of theory activity with promise of circumeventing some of the traditional theory bottlenecks (increased dimensionalities etc etc). \n",
    "\n",
    "* With Machine Learning, Quantum computing (QC) and quantum information (QI) are topics we believe should be of interest to the lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "* And what about our experimental activity?"
